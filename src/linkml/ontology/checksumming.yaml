title: Concepts for describing checksums of digital content
description: >
  Slightly modified naming of properties (for more compact/beautiful data),
  but identical semantics to the checksumming approach used by the DCAT v3
  vocabulary (https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3).

  Checksum:
    class_uri: dlco:Checksum
    description: >-
      A Checksum is a value that allows to check the integrity of the contents
      of a file. Even small changes to the content of the file will change its
      checksum. This class allows the results of a variety of checksum and
      cryptographic message digest algorithms to be represented.

        description: >-
