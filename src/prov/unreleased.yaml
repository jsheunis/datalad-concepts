title: Schema for a generic data provenance
description: |
  This schema builds on the [Thing schema](https://concepts.datalad.org/s/thing), and diversifies it to capture the key provenance concepts `Agent`, `Activity`, `Entity` and their relationships.
  It does that by drawing on (a subset) of the PROV data model [PROV-DM](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-dm).

  Central paradigm of the schema is the [qualified relation pattern](https://patterns.dataincubator.org/book/qualified-relation.html).
  The three `Thing` derived key concepts `Agent`, `Activity`, and `Entity` each provide a `relation` (symmetric property) slot for **inline declaration** of related things.
  This `relation` slot is also the **only** slots that permits inline declaration.
  A relationship can be further characterized by referencing a `Thing` by its object identifier in slots like `was_attributed_to` (for an `Agent`).
  Full relation qualification is supported via inline declaration of `Influence` (derived) class instances in slots like
 
  - `qualified_relation`: for an `EntityInfluence` on an `Entity`
  - `qualified_association`: for an `AgentInfluence` on an `Activity`
  - `qualified_attribution`: for an `AgentInfluence` on an `Entity`
